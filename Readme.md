## ⚡ Problem Statement: Pakistan’s Electricity Crisis

Pakistan grapples with a severe energy crisis, facing a **5,000–8,000 MW electricity shortfall**, resulting in **12–18 hours of daily load-shedding** in rural areas and disrupting industries. Over **64 million Pakistanis** lack reliable electricity access, and heavy reliance on fossil fuels (61% of energy production in 2022) contributes to high costs and environmental damage, with **679.34 million tons of CO2 emissions** in 2022. Electricity tariffs have risen by **155% since 2021**, making grid power unaffordable for many households.

Despite Pakistan’s **vast solar potential** due to its location in the Sunny Belt (average **16 MJ/m² daily global radiation**), only **3% of energy comes from renewables**. Barriers such as high upfront costs, limited awareness, and lack of access to financing hinder solar adoption. Solaiel Energy tackles these challenges with **AI-driven, cost-effective solar solutions**, reducing adoption barriers by **60%** and aligning with government initiatives for clean energy.
