# Solaiel Energy

"**Bright Ideas, Local Ties, Solar Rise**"

Welcome to the repository for **Solaiel Energy**, a project developed as part of the GDSC Solution Challenge. Solaiel Energy is both a mobile app and a website designed to empower users with innovative solar energy solutions.

## Origin
The name "Solaiel Energy" is inspired by the French word "soleil," meaning "sun," with a unique twist to create a fresh, modern identity. Combined with "Energy," it reflects our mission to harness the power of the sun to deliver sustainable, accessible energy solutions. Born out of a passion for renewable energy and technology, this project aims to address real-world challenges through the GDSC Solution Challenge framework.
