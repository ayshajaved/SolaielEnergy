## ⚡ Problem Statement: Pakistan’s Electricity Crisis

Pakistan is engulfed in a **severe electricity crisis**, with a **5,000–8,000 MW shortfall** plunging millions into darkness, particularly in rural areas where **12–18 hours of daily load-shedding** disrupts livelihoods, education, and healthcare. Over **64 million people** lack reliable electricity access, while skyrocketing tariffs—up **155% since 2021**—make grid power unaffordable for many. The nation’s heavy reliance on fossil fuels, accounting for **61% of energy production in 2022**, fuels **679.34 million tons of CO2 emissions** annually, accelerating climate change and environmental degradation.

Yet, Pakistan sits in the **Sunny Belt**, boasting a solar potential of **100,000 MW** with an average of **16 MJ/m² daily global radiation**, yet harnessing only **3% from renewables**. **Solar energy** offers a beacon of hope:
- **Abundant and Sustainable**: Delivers clean, renewable power to reduce fossil fuel dependence.
- **Reliable and Decentralized**: Provides consistent electricity to underserved regions, mitigating load-shedding.
- **Cost-Effective**: Plummeting solar costs, coupled with government support like **net metering** and **80% subsidies for residential solar**, make adoption viable.

However, barriers persist:
- **High Upfront Costs**: Deter households from investing in solar systems.
- **Limited Awareness**: Lack of knowledge about solar benefits and financing options.
- **Financing Gaps**: Insufficient access to affordable loans or payment plans.

**Solaiel Energy** rises to the challenge with an **AI-powered platform** that transforms solar adoption:
